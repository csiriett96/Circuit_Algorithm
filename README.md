# Circuit Algorithm

**Specification**

Develop a program in Java that uses heuristic techniques to calculate the most reliable circuit that can be made given a budget and a list of devices to be used in the circuit. This program will need to take in three parameters, a file, a budget and a limit. The file will consist of devices, each device has a cost and a reliability, using heuristic techniques you must produce the most reliable circuit that can be made using the devices in the given file. The cost of this circuit must be less than or equal to the budget supplied. The limit specifies the maximum number of iterates that can be tested to produce the most reliable circuit given the parameters. 

**Solution**
The heuristic technique that was applied to produce the solution was the simulated annealing.
